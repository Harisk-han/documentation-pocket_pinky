# Pinky — Pocket Pinky Vetting Agent

This documentation outlines the complete system for the **Pinky Pink Pill Vetting Agent** — an AI-powered dating strategy chatbot built on Botpress, designed to help Black women navigate dating with clarity, strategy, and confidence.

---

## Overview

Pinky is a conversational AI agent that operates across four core modes — Vetting, Coaching, Exit, and Swirling — and dynamically adjusts depth of content based on a tiered progression system. The bot is deployed via web embed and runs entirely within Botpress.

The top-level flow is:
1. User opens the chat and receives a personalized welcome message.
2. Botpress checks Supabase on every message to verify the user's subscription status and message quota.
3. If the user is within their 1-week free trial, they get full access with a **10-message daily limit**.
4. If the trial has expired and the user has not upgraded, they receive an upgrade prompt.
5. If the user is a confirmed Premium subscriber (verified via Supabase), they receive access with a **20-message daily limit** for the duration of their monthly subscription.
6. If the user is a confirmed **Ultra Premium** subscriber, they receive **unlimited access** via Pocket Pinky — no daily message cap.
7. If the user has an active **Ultra Consult** message pack (available to Premium subscribers only), messages are drawn from their pack balance with no daily cap until the pack is exhausted.
8. Pinky detects the user's dating stage and intent.
9. The user is routed into the appropriate mode (Vetting, Coaching, Exit, or Swirling).
10. Responses are delivered based on the user's current Knowledge Tier (1, 2, or 3).
11. Milestones are tracked to progressively unlock deeper content.

## Subscription & Access Model

Pinky uses a **four-tier access model** managed via Supabase.

| Access Level | Duration | Daily Message Limit | Behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Free Trial** | 1 week (one-time, no reset) | 10 messages per day | Full access to all features; hard stop at 10/day |
| **Trial Expired** | After 1 week, no payment | None | Upgrade prompt only — no advice delivered |
| **Premium** | Monthly paid subscription (verified via Supabase) | **20 messages per day** | Full access; daily limit resets at midnight |
| **Ultra Premium** | Higher-tier paid subscriber (verified via Supabase) | **Unlimited** | Full unrestricted access via Pocket Pinky feature |
| **Ultra Consult Pack** | Add-on purchase for Premium only (no expiry until pack used up) | **Unlimited per day until pack runs out** | Pack balance replaces daily limit entirely; not available to Ultra Premium |

**Key Rules:**
- The free trial is one-time only — it does not reset.
- Free trial users are limited to **10 messages per day** for 7 days.
- Botpress checks Supabase on **every message** to verify subscription status and remaining message quota.
- Premium subscribers hit a hard stop at 20 messages per day. The limit resets at midnight. No messages queue — the session ends at the limit.
- Ultra Premium subscribers have no message cap. The Pocket Pinky feature is active for their entire session.
- Ultra Consult packs are available to **Premium subscribers only**. Ultra Premium subscribers do not need them and cannot purchase them.
- Ultra Consult packs fully replace the daily limit for Premium users. Once the pack is exhausted, the standard 20-message daily limit resumes.
- Ultra Consult packs are available for purchase at: **$50 for 500 messages** or **$80 for 1,000 messages**.
- Safety Escalation always bypasses all message limits and subscription checks — safety resources are never gated.
- When Supabase confirms any paid subscription, the user's Name and Email are sent via webhook to n8n → Constant Contact.

## Pocket Pinky (Ultra Premium Feature)

**Pocket Pinky** is the name for the unrestricted access experience available exclusively to Ultra Premium subscribers. It is not a separate app or interface — it operates within the same Botpress chat bot. Ultra Premium users are identified via Supabase and automatically receive the Pocket Pinky experience: no daily message cap, no interruptions, full access to all tiers and all modes for every session.

---

## Ultra Consult Mode

Ultra Consult is a message pack add-on available to **Premium subscribers only**. It removes the daily message limit until the pack is used up. Ultra Premium subscribers do not have access to this add-on as their access is already unlimited.

| Pack | Price | Messages |
|---|---|---|
| Starter Pack | $50 | 500 messages |
| Power Pack | $80 | 1,000 messages |

- Pack balance is tracked in Supabase and decremented on each message.
- Packs do not expire by time — only by usage.
- Once a pack is exhausted, the user's standard 20-message daily limit resumes automatically.
- Ultra Premium subscribers cannot purchase Ultra Consult packs.

---

## Knowledge Tier System

Pinky uses a three-tier progressive content system. All tiers are accessible to free trial users and all paid subscribers. Trial-expired users must upgrade before any tier content is delivered.

| Tier | Name | Unlock Condition |
|---|---|---|
| **Tier 1** | Foundational | Default — all active users |
| **Tier 2** | Intermediate | messages, return visit, Him Report request, or "why" question |
| **Tier 3** | Advanced | sessions, long-term situation, advanced topic request, Swirling mode |

Full milestone tracking logic is documented in [Pinky Tier & Milestone Tracking](./Pinky_Tier_Milestone_Tracking.md).
