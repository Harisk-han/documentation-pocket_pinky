## Step-by-Step Node Documentation

---

### Node 1 — Welcome Message

**Type:** Message Node
**Trigger:** Conversation Start (new session)

**Purpose:**
Greets the user as soon as the chat opens. Introduces Pinky's identity, establishes tone, and presents the main menu options. For returning users, a shorter welcome-back message is displayed.

**New User Message:**
> "Hey Sis, I'm Pinky — your vetting partner and dating strategist. I'm here to help black women win in relationships. 💕
>
> I can help you:
> 🔍 Vet a man you're seeing
> 💬 Decode his texts
> ✨ Script what to say
> 📋 Get a full Him Report
> 👑 Find high-value men
> 🍦 Swirl Mode (Navigate interracial dating)
>
> What's on your mind today?"

**Returning User Message:**
> "Welcome back, Sis. What are we working on today?"

**Configuration Notes:**
- Use Botpress session variable `returning_user` (boolean) to conditionally display new vs. returning message.
- Display quick-reply buttons for each mode option below the message.
- Do NOT display PDF guide CTAs at this node — trust must be earned first.

**Quick Reply Buttons:**
| Button Label | Icon | Routes To |
|---|---|---|
| Vet Him | 🔍 | Vetting Mode Flow |
| Decode His Text | 💬 | Vetting Mode Flow |
| Script Me | ✨ | Coaching Mode Flow |
| Him Report | 📋 | Him Report Flow |
| HVM Mode | 👑 | Coaching Mode Flow |
| Swirling | 🍦 (custom swirl-icon.svg) | Swirling Mode Flow |
| Something Else | 💭 | Intent Detection Node |

> **Icon Note:** The Swirling button must use the custom `swirl-icon.svg` asset. Do NOT use a standard ice cream emoji.

---

### Node 2 — Subscription & Quota Check (Supabase)

**Type:** API Call / Condition Node
**Trigger:** Runs on EVERY message before any content is delivered

**Purpose:**
Checks the user's subscription status AND remaining message quota in Supabase on every message. This is the access gate for the entire bot. It handles five distinct access states: Free Trial (10 msg/day for 7 days), Trial Expired, Premium (20 msg/day monthly), Ultra Premium (unlimited via Pocket Pinky), and Ultra Consult Pack (pack-based, Premium only).

**How It Works:**
- Botpress makes an API call to Supabase on each incoming message, passing the user's identifier.
- Supabase returns the user's current status and, where applicable, their remaining message balance.
- The result is stored in the session variables `subscription_status`, `daily_messages_used`, and `consult_pack_balance`.
- Botpress evaluates the combined state and routes accordingly.

**Status & Quota Logic:**

| Supabase Status | Condition | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `free_trial_active` | Trial start date is within 7 days AND `daily_messages_used < 10` | Allow access — increment `daily_messages_used` — proceed to Node 3 |
| `free_trial_active` | Trial start date is within 7 days AND `daily_messages_used >= 10` | Route to Daily Limit Wall (trial variant) — stop flow |
| `ultra_premium_active` | Ultra Premium payment confirmed | Allow full unlimited access (Pocket Pinky) — proceed to Node 3 |
| `consult_pack_active` | `consult_pack_balance > 0` (Premium user with active pack) | Allow full access — decrement pack balance by 1 — proceed to Node 3 |
| `premium_active` | Payment confirmed AND `daily_messages_used < 20` | Allow access — increment `daily_messages_used` — proceed to Node 3 |
| `premium_active` | Payment confirmed AND `daily_messages_used >= 20` | Route to Daily Limit Wall — stop flow |
| `trial_expired` | Trial > 7 days AND no payment | Route to Upgrade Prompt Node — stop flow |

**Upgrade Prompt Message (Trial Expired):**
> "Hey Sis, your free week is up! 💕 You've gotten a taste of what Pinky can do — now it's time to go premium and keep the strategy coming.
>
> Upgrade now to get 20 messages a day all month long, plus access to vetting, coaching, Him Reports, and everything else.
>
> [Upgrade to Premium →]"

**Daily Limit Wall Message — Free Trial (10 messages reached):**
> "Hey Sis, you've hit your 10 daily messages for today! 💕 Your limit resets at midnight — come back tomorrow to keep going.
>
> Or upgrade to Premium now and get 20 messages a day for the whole month.
>
> [Upgrade to Premium →]"

**Daily Limit Wall Message — Premium (20 messages reached):**
> "Hey Sis, you've hit your 20 daily messages for today! 💕 Your limit resets at midnight — come back tomorrow to keep the strategy going.
>
> Or, if you want to keep going right now, grab an Ultra Consult pack and pick up right where we left off.
>
> [Get 500 Messages — $50] [Get 1,000 Messages — $80]"

**Configuration Notes:**
- The free trial is **one-time only** — it does not reset regardless of account changes.
- The trial start date must be stored as a user-level variable (`trial_start_date`) on first interaction.
- `daily_messages_used` resets to `0` at midnight (server time) each day for both Free Trial and Premium users.
- Ultra Premium users (`ultra_premium_active`) are never subject to the daily message cap — their `daily_messages_used` counter is not evaluated.
- Ultra Consult packs are available to **Premium subscribers only**. Ultra Premium users cannot purchase or use packs.
- Ultra Consult pack balance (`consult_pack_balance`) is decremented by 1 on every message. When balance reaches `0`, status reverts to standard `premium_active` logic (20 msg/day cap resumes).
- Consult pack purchases append to the existing balance — they do not reset it (e.g., buying a 500-pack when 200 remain results in a 700-message balance).
- After either the upgrade prompt or the daily limit wall is sent, the bot delivers **no further content** in that message cycle.
- Safety Escalation (Node 5) bypasses the subscription and quota check entirely — safety resources are always available.
- When Supabase returns any paid status for the first time (`premium_active`, `ultra_premium_active`), the user's Name and Email are sent via webhook to n8n → Constant Contact (see Web Integration doc).

**Session Variables Used:**
- `subscription_status` — current access state (`free_trial_active`, `trial_expired`, `premium_active`, `ultra_premium_active`, `consult_pack_active`)
- `trial_start_date` — timestamp of first interaction (user-level, persists across sessions)
- `is_premium` — boolean, set to `true` when Supabase confirms any paid tier
- `is_ultra_premium` — boolean, set to `true` for Ultra Premium subscribers (Pocket Pinky)
- `consult_pack_balance` — integer, remaining messages in active Ultra Consult pack (Premium only)
- `daily_messages_used` — integer, messages used today by this user (applies to Free Trial and Premium; resets at midnight)
- `daily_reset_timestamp` — timestamp of the last daily counter reset

### Node 3 — Dating Stage Detection

**Type:** AI / NLU Classification Node
**Trigger:** After subscription/quota check passes, on first substantive user input

**Purpose:**
Identifies where the user is in her dating journey. This shapes Pinky's tone, depth, and approach throughout the session.

**Stage Classification Table:**

| Stage | Signals to Detect | Pinky's Approach |
|---|---|---|
| **Seeking** | Single, actively looking, "where do I meet men" | Coaching-heavy. Strategy and positioning. |
| **Early Dating** | New person, 1–5 dates, still assessing | Balanced. Light vetting, encourage observation. |
| **Situationship** | Undefined relationship, wants clarity | Vetting-heavy. Name the pattern, give verdict. |
| **Committed** | In a relationship, questioning whether to stay | Deep vetting. Assess patterns over time. |
| **Exiting** | Decided to leave, actively leaving | Exit Mode. Support, scripts, safety. |

**Configuration Notes:**
- Store detected stage in session variable: `dating_stage`
- Use keyword and intent detection to classify
- Stage detection runs once at the start of a session but can be updated if the user's situation shifts
- If stage is ambiguous, proceed to Intent Detection (Node 4) and let mode selection clarify

---

### Node 4 — Intent Detection (Mode Router)

**Type:** Router / Condition Node
**Trigger:** After stage detection, or when user types a free-form message without selecting a button

**Purpose:**
Reads the user's message and determines which mode to activate. Acts as the central routing logic for the entire bot.

**Routing Logic:**

| Condition | Routes To |
|---|---|
| User mentions a specific man or situation | Vetting Mode Flow |
| User asks for skills, scripts, or general strategy | Coaching Mode Flow |
| User says she's leaving or done | Exit Mode Flow |
| User mentions interracial dating or swirling | Swirling Mode Flow |
| User clicks "Him Report" | Him Report Flow |
| Safety keywords detected (at any point) | Safety Escalation Flow |
| Input is unclear | Ask clarifying question, re-route |

**Configuration Notes:**
- Safety keyword check runs on EVERY message — it is not gated to this node only
- Use intent classification trained on the mode trigger examples from the prompt
- Store active mode in session variable: `active_mode`
- If user switches context mid-conversation, re-route gracefully without losing prior context

---

### Node 5 — Safety Keyword Monitor

**Type:** Global Interrupt / Condition Node
**Trigger:** Passive — monitors every user message in every flow

**Purpose:**
Continuously checks all user input for language indicating abuse, danger, coercive control, or self-harm. If triggered, this node immediately overrides all other active flows and escalates to the Safety Escalation Flow.

> **Important:** Safety escalation bypasses the subscription check AND all message quota limits entirely. A user with an expired trial or a user who has hit their daily message cap still receives safety resources without interruption.

**Trigger Keywords (Examples):**
- "he hit me," "he hurt me," "I'm scared," "he threatened me"
- "I don't feel safe," "he controls me," "I can't leave"
- References to weapons, physical harm, stalking, or financial abuse

**Configuration Notes:**
- This node must be configured as a **global interrupt** — it fires regardless of which flow is active
- Always escalate to the HIGHEST severity level detected
- Do NOT continue dating advice after safety escalation until user confirms they are safe
- No emojis during safety conversations
- Reference the `pinkpill-Risk-escalationprotocols` knowledge base for exact response templates
